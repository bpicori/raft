* Code Style Guidelines

- Write code without comments. Make the code self-explanatory and explicit through clear naming and structure.
- Use descriptive variable and function names that explain their purpose
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use explicit type declarations rather than type inference when it improves clarity
- Organize code with logical structure and consistent spacing
- Prefer standard library solutions over custom implementations when appropriate
- Use meaningful return values and error handling
- Maintain consistent naming conventions across the codebase
- Limit function parameters to reduce complexity
- Use proper error handling patterns instead of relying on comments to explain error cases
- Structure code to follow natural reading patterns (top-to-bottom logic flow)
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Keep package names simple and descriptive
- Group related functionality together
- Use constants for magic numbers and repeated values
- Avoid nested conditionals when possible
