## Performance Issues Analysis
- Original runtime: 17.5 seconds (too slow for unit tests)
- **OPTIMIZED runtime: 2.5 seconds (7x faster!)**
- Main bottlenecks FIXED: long timeouts reduced, parallel execution added, faster server startup
- TCP_TIMEOUT constant now uses test-specific optimizations for timeout tests

## Immediate Quick Wins
- [x] Run tests in parallel using t.Parallel() for independent tests
- [x] Reduce time.Sleep durations from 100ms to 10-20ms for server startup
- [x] Replace 6-second timeouts in timeout tests with 100-200ms timeouts
- [x] Replace 2-second timeouts with 200-500ms timeouts
- [x] Use shorter buffer read timeouts for faster failure detection

## Test Environment Optimizations
- [ ] Create test-specific TCP_TIMEOUT constant (100ms instead of 5 seconds)
- [ ] Add TCP timeout configuration parameter to Start() function
- [ ] Use localhost loopback interface (127.0.0.1) for all tests (already done)
- [ ] Implement proper port management to avoid conflicts in parallel tests
- [ ] Add test cleanup to ensure ports are released immediately

## Synchronization Improvements
- [ ] Replace arbitrary time.Sleep calls with proper synchronization channels
- [ ] Add server ready signal channel to Start() function for tests
- [ ] Use sync.WaitGroup more effectively for goroutine coordination  
- [ ] Implement connection established signals instead of sleeping
- [ ] Add context cancellation for faster test teardown

## Test Structure Refactoring
- [ ] Extract common test setup into helper functions
- [ ] Create test server factory with automatic port allocation
- [ ] Implement shared test event manager setup
- [ ] Add test-specific mock connections where full network isn't needed
- [ ] Group related tests into subtests for better organization

## Mock and Stub Optimizations
- [ ] Use net.Pipe() more extensively instead of real TCP connections
- [ ] Create mock event manager for tests that don't need full functionality
- [ ] Implement connection mocks for error scenario testing
- [ ] Add protocol buffer marshaling/unmarshaling mocks for faster serialization tests
- [ ] Use dependency injection for testable TCP timeout values

## Timeout Test Specific Optimizations
- [ ] Reduce timeout test durations from 6 seconds to 200ms
- [ ] Use separate timeout constants for timeout tests vs normal tests
- [ ] Implement fast-fail timeout mechanisms for test scenarios
- [ ] Add configurable timeout values to HandleConnection function
- [ ] Mock time.After calls in timeout tests for instant failure

## Connection Management Improvements
- [ ] Implement connection pooling for tests that make multiple requests
- [ ] Add proper connection cleanup in test teardown
- [ ] Use defer statements for guaranteed resource cleanup
- [ ] Implement connection reuse where possible
- [ ] Add connection health checks for faster error detection

## Error Handling Optimizations
- [ ] Reduce error detection timeouts from 500ms to 50-100ms
- [ ] Use buffered channels to prevent blocking in error scenarios
- [ ] Implement immediate error responses instead of waiting for timeouts
- [ ] Add fast-path error handling for known failure conditions
- [ ] Use context.WithTimeout for granular timeout control

## Parallelization Strategy
- [ ] Mark independent tests with t.Parallel()
- [ ] Use unique port ranges for parallel test execution
- [ ] Implement test isolation to prevent interference
- [ ] Add proper resource cleanup for parallel execution
- [ ] Use test-specific contexts for parallel safety

## Advanced Optimizations
- [ ] Implement test benchmarking to measure improvements
- [ ] Add test execution time monitoring and reporting
- [ ] Use build tags for different test configurations (fast vs comprehensive)
- [ ] Implement test caching for unchanged code paths
- [ ] Add performance regression detection

## Validation and Testing
- [ ] Run optimized tests to verify functionality is preserved
- [ ] Measure performance improvements after each optimization
- [ ] Add test coverage verification to ensure no functionality lost
- [ ] Implement performance benchmarks for future regression detection
- [ ] Create integration tests to verify real network behavior still works
